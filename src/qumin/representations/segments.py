    """The static `segments.Inventory` class describes a sound inventory.

    This class is static, so that all other modules can access its current state,
    without passing an inventory instance everywhere.

    The inventory first needs to be initialized with a distinctive features file.

    Each sound class in the inventory is a concept in a FCA lattice.
    Sound class identifiers are either strings (for phonemes)
    or frozensets (for sound classes). Phonemes are the leaves of the hierarchy.

    Sound classes can be seen as under-determined phonemes, and both phonemes and sound
    classes are handled in the same way. For this reason, we call both "sound".

    Static Attributes:
        _lattice: the FCA lattice underlying the feature space
        _score_matrix (dict): a dictionnary of sound tuples to alignment score
        _gap_score (float): a score for insertions
        _normalization (dict): a dictionnary of sounds to their normalized counterparts
        _segmenter (re.pattern): a compiled regex to segment words into phonemes
        _legal_str (re.pattern): a compiled regex to recognize words made of known phonemes
        _max (frozenset): the identifier of the supremum in the lattice
        _regexes_end (dict): a dictionnary of sound IDs to regex strings (to use at the end of words) -- currently unused
        _regexes (dict): a dictionnary of sound IDs to regex strings
        _pretty_str (dict): a dictionnary of sound IDs to pretty formatted strings
        _features (dict): a dictionnary of sound IDs to set of features
        _features_str (dict): a dictionnary of sound IDs to a string representing features
